# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 

https://www.airbnb.com

https://www.vrbo.com

https://www.bluepillow.com



*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 

These websites are a relevant comparison because they are all websites that offer full-home rentals. 


*List at least 10 product features*

1. a user can share "saved home" lists with others
2. a user can filter listings by type of home (cabin, lakefront, tinyhomes, treehouses, etc.)
3. a user can list their own home
4. a user can browse through pictures of a property without clicking on the listing (the listing thumbnails are carousels)
5. a user can filter listings by price
6. a user can message the host of a listing
7. a user can change their region to show listings in a different currency (e.g. changing region from the US to the UK to show listings in GBP rather than USD)
8. a user can move the map around to search for listings in a specific area rather than searching for a specific city
9. a user can search through reviews (e.g. they can search for the word "bad" and it'll bring up any reviews with the word)
10. a user can filter listings by accessibility features (step-free access, disabled parking spot, etc.)
   

## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that the Marriott website could better support users who are still exploring options. Quantitative research showed that just under a quarter of the 3,181 people surveyed had an exact destination in mind, meaning the site needs to cater more toward users who are open to different possibilities. In the video research, both users found the map overwhelming, felt the site was geared toward people with set destinations, and questioned the accessibility of the luxurious home featured on the homepage. Overall, users wish for a more exploration-friendly experience, with more guidance and clearer information about destinations.



## Define and Prototype
*Paste a link to your prototype here* 
> **üóíÔ∏è NOTE:** Make sure you share your prototype file so that "anyone with the link" can view it. If we're unable to access your file, we'll be unable to give you credit.

*Don't forget to include a comment if you attempted any of the LevelUps, so that your grader knows to review your work and award the extra credit!*

Level-Ups

- hi-fi prototype: I added picture thumbnails to the drop down menu. I also added sheer overlays behind pop-ups (both the original "Where do you want to go" pop-up and the city highlight pop-ups)

- added feature/website section: I added blurbs about each city when the user clicks on the destination pin. I added this to provide users with helpful context and insights into what makes each destination unique. This addresses feedback that users wanted more information to explore and decide on destinations that suit their interests.
