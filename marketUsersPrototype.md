# Market, Users, Prototype

## Market Overview
I explored several platforms offering vacation rental services to understand the competitive landscape. The following websites were particularly relevant for comparison:

- [Airbnb](https://www.airbnb.com)
- [Vrbo](https://www.vrbo.com)
- [BluePillow](https://www.bluepillow.com)

These websites were chosen because they provide similar services in offering full-home rentals, which aligns with the idea of recommending destinations based on user preferences. Understanding how these platforms cater to different user needs, including filtering options, price, and accessibility, helped inform my approach to creating a user-friendly recommendation system.

### Key Features from Competitor Platforms:
- Ability to share "saved home" lists with others.
- Filtering options for different types of homes (e.g., cabins, treehouses, lakefront properties).
- Users can list their own properties.
- Interactive property images (carousel-style thumbnails).
- Price filtering for listings.
- Messaging features for direct contact with property hosts.
- Region-based currency adjustments (e.g., USD to GBP).
- Map-based searching to locate listings in specific areas.
- Search functionality within reviews (e.g., searching for specific words like "bad").
- Accessibility filters, such as step-free access or disabled parking.

## User Insights
User research indicates that the Marriott website could better serve users who are still exploring vacation options. Quantitative data from a survey of 3,181 people revealed that just under a quarter knew exactly where they wanted to go, suggesting the site needs to cater more to those open to a variety of possibilities. Video feedback highlighted several common pain points: users found the map feature overwhelming, felt the site was more suited to those with a set destination in mind, and raised concerns about the accessibility of the luxurious home featured on the homepage. While users appreciated the categorization of homes by amenities like pools or patios, they generally preferred to choose a destination first and then find a home, rather than the reverse. 

Additionally, users expressed a desire for more information, especially regarding what makes the "popular" destinations stand out. Overall, there is a clear preference for a more exploration-friendly experience, with better guidance, more helpful explanations, and enhanced support for discovering new destinations.

## Prototype
Hereâ€™s a link to the prototype I developed to visualize the user flow and design for the recommendation system:

### Prototype Enhancements:
- **Hi-Fi Prototype**: I added picture thumbnails to the destination dropdown menu and created a more polished design with sheer overlays behind the pop-ups (including the initial "Where do you want to go?" modal and the city highlight pop-ups).
- **City Information**: I added a new feature where users can see a short blurb about each destination when clicking on the destination pin. This additional context helps users understand what makes each location unique, providing them with more information to explore and make informed decisions.
